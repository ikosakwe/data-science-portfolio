# NBA MVP Probability Predictor

## Introduction

The main objective of this visualization was to create a fun yet informative too to understand the statistics behind what makes the NBA’s best player. 

As a basketball fan myself, I thoroughly enjoyed both building and utilizing it. My goal is for fellow basketballs to peruse this tool for their pleasure.

The predictor can be used to explore the most important statistical factors in determining the NBA’s MVP; or, it can be used to assessed any player’s current or previous probability of being MVP given the statistics.

## Running the Demo

```sh
$ npm install

```

In a new shell, start the server:
```sh
$ npm run start-server

```

Next, start the client:

```

Open the client running at: http://localhost:8080/
